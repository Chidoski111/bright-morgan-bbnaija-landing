# Decision Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-08-01 | Updated landing page content from generic portfolio to BBNaija campaign page for Bright Morgan | Used bright-docs content as data source while preserving the sophisticated design aesthetic. Transformed all major sections: Landing (BBNaija branding), Description (Bright's story), Projects (talents showcase), Contact (voting info), Header (BBNaija navigation), and SlidingImages (Bright's photos). |
| 2025-08-01 | Enhanced scroll smoothness and fixed footer positioning | Improved Locomotive Scroll configuration with cubic easing (duration: 1.8s, lerp: 0.1) for smoother wheel interactions. Fixed Contact component positioning by removing excessive margins and using padding instead, ensuring proper component flow after LiveStats. Added functional social media and voting links with WhatsApp integration for better user engagement. |
| 2025-08-01 | Updated navigation with official DSTV URLs | Replaced placeholder navigation links with official DSTV URLs: About Bright now links to his profile page (https://www.dstv.com/africamagic/en-ng/show/big-brother-naija/season/10/housemates/bright-morgan/op_profile) and Vote Bright links to official voting page (https://www.dstv.com/africamagic/en-ng/show/big-brother-naija/season/10/vote). Enhanced Link component to handle external URLs with proper target="_blank" attributes for better user experience. |
| 2025-08-01 | Updated vote links and disabled scrolling on sliding images | Updated all vote links throughout the application to use the correct DSTV URL (https://www.dstv.com/africamagic/en-ng/show/big-brother-naija/season/10/vote) and added About Bright link to the navbar (https://www.dstv.com/africamagic/en-ng/show/big-brother-naija/season/10/housemates/bright-morgan/op_profile). Disabled wheel scrolling and scrollbars on the sliding images component using overflow:hidden, pointer-events:none on container, and preventDefault on wheel/scroll events to prevent unwanted scrolling behavior while maintaining image interaction functionality. |
| 2025-08-01 | Improved navbar design and removed scrolling from sliding images | Removed the dot indicators and underlines from navbar to create clean, consistent styling matching BBNaija Journey link. Added gold hover effects (#FFD700) for better visual feedback. Removed Contact nav item as not needed yet. Fixed sliding images by removing scrollbars and wheel events completely, preventing unwanted scrolling behavior. Updated all voting URLs to official DSTV BBNaija Season 10 links for proper functionality. |
